                                    It is the state's primate city both in area and population and is located on the
                                    Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census,
                                    Chennai
                                    is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous
                                    urban
                                    agglomeration. Incorporated in 1866, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the
                                    oldest
                                    municipal corporation of India and the second oldest in the world after London.

                                    Historically, Chennai and surroundings were part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava
                                    and
                                    Vijayanagara kingdoms for many centuries. The coastal land, which then contained
                                    the
                                    fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company
                                    from the Nayak ruler Damarla Chennapa Nayaka, in the 17th century. The British
                                    garrison established the Madras city and port, and built Fort St. George—the
                                    first
                                    British fortress in India—which the French won over briefly in 1746, before
                                    becoming
                                    the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British
                                    Raj
                                    in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained its independence in 1947, Madras
                                    continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu.

                                    over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore has a pleasant climate

                                    "Garden City".[11] Its elevation is the highest among India's major cities.[12]

                                    The city's history dates back to around 890, as found in a stone inscription
                                    found
                                    at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537, Kempé Gowdā, a feudal
                                    ruler
                                    under the Vijayanagara Empire, established a mud fort, considered the foundation

                                    modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or pétés, which still exist. After the
                                    fall
                                    of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large

                                    Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore came under Shahaji
                                    Bhonsle as a jagir, which later became his capital. The Mughals later captured
                                    Bangalore and sold it to Maharaja Devaraja Wodeyar II of the Kingdom of
                                    Mysore.[13]
                                    When Haider Ali seized control of the kingdom, Bangalore's administration passed
                                    into his hands.

                                    in the historic region of Bengal.[1][18][19] It is the second largest
                                    Bengali-speaking city in the world. It has the highest number of nobel laureates
                                    among all cities in India.

                                    The three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal
                                    under
                                    Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading
                                    licence
                                    in 1690,[20] the area was developed by the Company into Fort William. Nawab
                                    Siraj
                                    ud-Daulah occupied the fort in 1756 but was defeated at the Battle of Plassey in
                                    1757, after his general Mir Jafar mutinied in support of the Company, and was
                                    later
                                    made the Nawab for a brief time.[21] Under company and later crown rule,
                                    Calcutta
                                    served as the de facto capital of India until 1911. Calcutta was the second
                                    largest
                                    city in the British Empire, after London.[22] and was the center of bureaucracy,
                                    politics, law, education, science and the arts in India. The city was associated
                                    with many of the figures and movements of the Bengali Renaissance. It was the
                                    hotbed
                                    of the Indian nationalist movement.[23] The University of Calcutta and its
                                    affiliated colleges produced many leading figures of South Asia.

                                    Kolkata's architecture includes many imperial landmarks, including the Victoria
                                    Memorial, Howrah Bridge and the Grand Hotel. The city's heritage includes
                                    India's
                                    only Chinatown and remnants of Jewish, Armenian, Greek and Anglo-Indian
                                    communities.
                                    The city is closely linked with Bhadralok culture and the Zamindars of Bengal,
                                    including Bengali Hindu, Bengali Muslim and tribal aristocrats. The partition of
                                    Bengal affected the fortunes of the city. In the late 20th century, the city
                                    hosted
                                    the government-in-exile of Bangladesh during the Pakistani Civil War in
                                    1971;[24] it
                                    built India's first subway; and it was overtaken by Mumbai (formerly Bombay) as
                                    India's largest city. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port. The
                                    city
                                    is often regarded as India's cultural capital.

                                    The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591
                                    to
                                    extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed

                                    the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty
                                    and
                                    founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the
                                    imperial capital of the Asaf Jahi's from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the
                                    princely
                                    state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until
                                    Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948
                                    and
                                    continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the
                                    introduction
                                    of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the
                                    newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state
                                    of
                                    Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a
                                    transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has
                                    housed
                                    the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.

                                    Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has
                                    come
                                    to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had
                                    declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from
                                    various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of
                                    local and migrated artisans, with Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature,
                                    dialect and clothing are prominent still today. Through its cuisine, the city is
                                    listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry
                                    based in
                                    the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021.

                                    Until the 19th century Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was
                                    nicknamed
                                    the "City of Pearls", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in
                                    the
                                    world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open.
                                    Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats,
                                    and
                                    industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research,
                                    manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city
                                    has
                                    emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information
                                    technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and
                                    HITEC
                                    City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals
                                    to
                                    set up operations in Hyderabad.
